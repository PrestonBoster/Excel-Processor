The function proccess_workbook begins by loading an Excel file using the openpyxl library and accessing the first sheet named 'Sheet1'. This setup allows us to manipulate the data within the specified sheet. Initially, the function demonstrates accessing the first cell (A1) in two different ways, though these actions do not influence the subsequent operations.

Next, the function processes the data by iterating over each row, starting from the second row up to the last row. For each row, it retrieves the value from the third column (column C), calculates a 10% discount on this value, and writes the discounted price into the fourth column (column D). This loop ensures that all rows have their prices adjusted and updated accordingly.

After updating the prices, the function creates a bar chart to visualize the corrected prices. It defines the data range for the chart, specifying that it includes all rows from the second to the last row in the fourth column. This range is encapsulated in a Reference object, which is then used to create and configure a BarChart object.

Finally, the function adds the bar chart to the sheet at cell E2 and saves the workbook with these modifications. This includes both the newly calculated corrected prices in column D and the bar chart. Overall, the function automates the process of applying a discount to a list of prices and visualizing the results, making data processing in Excel more efficient and error-free.
